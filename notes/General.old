I took houses out just for a brief time...that code in therre
is a trainwreck, especially for do_house which handles the
building of the house, selling, listing, etc. I'm gonna write
it from scratch tomorrow.

Oh yeah, I remembered later that I hadn't rebooted the
mud with copyover to ensure that there's no problematic
rom executable and potential crashes.
 
Thanks and I've already started rewriting the player homes.

Subject Questmaster quirk, bug or feature?~
Text
When you are waiting on the timer to expire to get another quest
if you use quest resign it will reset the time to zero
even if you're not on a quest at the time.
The same thing happens if you get a quest you don't want,
just resign the quest you got and request another until you get one
that you like.

I have no idea what it causing it but I have been fighting kenders
and the mud seems to randomly crash. I wasn't using any skills
or anything when it did it, besides circle, but that was already
done when it would crash.
