Hi
For some reason when you use "gain" to gain a new skill/spell.
It can put your trains into the negative value.

Subject dragonform~
Text
It seems that there are still problems with dragonform, when you type
dragonform to remove it, instead of removing whatever ac bonus it is
supposed to give from your base ac. It simply raises your base ac by
that much. So when you turn it on it lowers your ac like it is supposed
to but when you turn it off it raises you base ac by that amount
I am up to like 1500 ac in every type except pierce which seems to work
like it is supposed to

Subject re: dragonform~
Text
Little more info on the dragonform bug, whenever I use it, it does the HR/DR
bonus right. Except if I log out and back in with it on it saves the form
I am in, i.e. If I am dragon when i log out once I log back in the bonus is gone
but if I use dragonform it say it returns me to human.
 
Also whenever I use it it adds something like 400 to 500 ac (i haven't really
counted lol) that happens wether I am turning it off or on. the more
times i use it the more ac it adds. i was up to like 5000 ac earlier 
when i was playing with it. thankfully when i quit to the character screen
and come back in it fixes my ac. One funny thing to note is the fact
that turning it off or on either one does nothing to my ac -vs- pierce
 
Just figure more info might help you pin down the bug
