The lush greenery and staggering trees continue.  This forest has been
standing for ages out of mind.  It is the culmination of all the beauty and
wisdom that exists in nature.  Legend tells that the goddess of nature
herself resides in the groves of this sacred place.  In the distance,
through the tree tops can be seen a slate gray tower.  The only darkness in
this wonderful haven.  The trail forks here, it continues on north and west.

Another large bedroom, not much different than the others.  A four post
bed lies flush against the north wall.  A large desk with many papers strewn
about in a bid for Lazumens immediate attention sits on the eastern most
wall.  Two large beautifully paintned portraits hang on the western wall,
one is of Lazumen as a young man, the other is of his wife Meliwyn.  They
were painted for him and his wife by a very famous artist out of gratitude,
for Lazumen saved his life.  North leads back to the hallway.

This is the entrance to Crimson Tower.  The simple four walled room is
sheer white.  Bright, eye burning white.  It is a very sharp contrast to the
world that lies outside the door.  A small pool of blood has gathered in the
center of the room.  This is the farthest any of the brave men who came here
dare go.  Many have never made it back out.  A heavy force lies in the air,
pulsating rapidly, making ones mind hazy.  A small door lies to the east,
south will take you out of Crimson Tower.

A bright ball of pulsing blue light tries to overwhelm your senses.  The
eerie humming sound grows to a cacophony of brilliant and screeching sounds
that threaten to blood ones ears.  In the center of it all, is a creature of
indescribable size.  It takes up most of ones peripheral vision, and goes on
for miles in each direction.  It has no shape, yet is every shape, its ever
changing face reveals elves, humans, orcs, and a few creatures not known in
this realm of existance.  This creature is older than time, older than
thought.  To try and comprehend it, is beyond the reach of a mortals mind.

{D-={RLair Of Tempest{D=-{x~
The master of storm and squall.  Whether it be a rainy drizzle or a
thunderous typhoon, Tempest can harness it, wield it, destroy with it. 
Thousands of black scorches are all over the walls, no doubt the victims of
Tempests' whipcrack bolts of lightning.  He is the wizard, all wizards
aspire to be like, though he is only a legend.  He is however, very real,
and resides in the tower.  Awaiting the time that he may rule the world.  A
large skylight has been crudely cut into the ceiling.  The sky above is
black with thunderclouds.  North leads back to the hallway.

{D-={bDungeon Cell{D=-{X~
The walls, floor, and ceiling are so black they are barely seen in the
small glowing light cast by a torch outside the cell door.  All around are
the moans and groans of agony, hunger, and desperation.  Many of the
prisoners are resigned to their situation and are ready to die whenever they
will.  The cell door is to the north, it looks locked up quite well though. 
A small hole can be seen in the top part of the ceiling.

This foul smelling hallway is rather bright.  Many torches are burning
away on the walls.  They cast their glow on a few other cell doors
containing other persons damned by the Crimson Lord.  The dungeon continues
to the west.  There is a cell to the south.
