The forest path stops when it comes to the stone path that leads to a
large, stone castle.  There are no birds and no wild animals, even the trees
look dark and menacing.  The road is old and dusty and appears to not have
been used very much lately.

The gates of the castle stand tall and ominous at the end of the dirt

The castle gates might once have been a formidable defense against even
the strongest of foes, but now stands rusted and askew.  The gates seem to
have once been made from the strongest of metals but now are covered in
rust...  And the blood of the innocent.

This room once served as a private room to the guard who stood watch at
the gates but now serves to warn travellers of the danger that is within the
castle.  The walls are splattered with the blood of the guard, his bed has
been torn and stained with his blood.  There is a skeleton tossed in the
corner, maybe the remains of a skeleton would be a better description for
most of it has been crushed to bone dust under the might of his murderer.

The path that leads to the castle doors is one made of stones that have
been worn down and broken away by use and weather.  Many feet have touched
the surface of this road over the years since it was built, all the victims
that this castle has claimed have tread upon this road before being
slaughtered like animals inside the very building that now looms ahead.
