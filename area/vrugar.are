{DCenter of {rV{Dr{ru{Dg{ra{Dr{X~
This part of the cavern is lit very well.  Lots of torches hang about
illuminating each and every dank crevice of this gloomy place.  Alot of
orcs, gnolls, and others who call this place home are milling about, talking
gruffly to each other.  This is the main hub of Vrugar.  To the north down a
long cavern is where the mutant's call home.  To the east, the goblins.  To
the south, the gnolls.  To the west, the orcs.  There is a small stairway
carved into the earth going up to the guildmaster, quester, and other
places.  The stairway also leads down deeper into the caves where some
residents have set up shops.

A small reception area of the temple for travellers to recall too.  The
ever present black slime is intensified here tenfold.  The dankess and
darkness is almost overwhelming, but somehow...  Comforting.  To the west is
a small place to heal your wounds.  East leads to the cavernous Mutant
Homes.
