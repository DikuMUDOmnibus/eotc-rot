The proving grounds for many a headstrong adventurer.  The Tower of
Trials has been a coming of age test for centuries past, and will remain so
for centuries more.  Built from solid granite, and standing more than two
hundred feet into the air, it is a marvel of old world engineering.  The
monsters that lie within are dangerous, many a youth has ventured inside,
only to succumb to the danger within.  A small stone path leads away north,
to the entrance of the tower.
