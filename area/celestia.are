{WEntrance To The C{wel{cest{wia{Wl Temple{x~
A gigantic awe inspiring temple stands here.  Large stone pillars, almost
thirty feet high support the massive roof.  Gleaming marble steps, nearly
three dozen lead up into the main temple.  The building goes on for what
seems like ever, it must of took decades to complete.  This temple was a
sacred place for study of the arcane arts.  It turned out thousands of
students expertly skilled in spellcraft.  Over time it was infested with
monsters seeking such powers, it is now a very dangerous place, yet still
holds many wonders within.  North leads to the temple steps.

The giant pillars visible from the entrance are now on either side of the
gleaming temple gate.  Arcane symbols have been painstakingly inscribed upon
the pillars.  They are almost illegible due to the toll time, wind, and rain
have taken on this hallowed ground.  The gates, however, still shine
brightly.  They are closed tight, barring any further entrance into the
temple.  North leads inside, south back down the steps.

{WInside The Temple{x~
The floor is made entirely of highly polished black marble.  Stark white
pillars jut out of the floor and rise twenty-five feet into the air to meet
with the ceiling.  The ceiling itself is constructed from criss crossing
beams of solid rock.  The center contains a large glass dome with
intricately detailed glass panels that give a kaliedoscoped view of the
sprawling sky.  A radiant glow is eminating from places unknown.  The
luminous glow wraps around the pillars and walls.  North leads to the center
of the temple.  A small room is to the west.  There is no way out of here at
the moment.

A stuffy reception room for new pupils to sign up and get started with

few dusty scraps of paper are scattered about it.  The school kept
impeccable, accurate, up-to-date records of every mage that passed through
their doors.  Behind the desk can be seen another, smaller room.  East leads

of the magic academy.  The altar is north.

{WThe Altar{x~
The altar is bigger than it appeared just a few moments ago.  It rests on
a gold base that fits over the bottom snugly while keeping it from touching
the floor.  The altar itself is a large slab of unidentifiable black stone. 
Thousands of runic and arcane symbols are carved into its surface.  Some of
the edges are worn, a corner looks to have been blasted off by lightning or
some other magic.  The altar has been the focus of many bloody battles, it
is believed to contain great power.  The air around it tinges with energy. 
A raw unrelenting force buzzes across its surface.  South leads back to the
main temple.

walls.  Spouting off trickling blue flames, they are made to last for quite
a long time.  There are no decorative features here, it is merely a legnth
of hall with classrooms on either side.  The main temple is back east, the

Parchment and scrolls are scattered about this dusty room.  A few tables
are still upright, their thick surfaces scratched and worn by hundreds of
successful and failed attempts at spellcraft.  A large marble desk sits at
the front of the class.  The room has been thoroughly ransacked by the
monsters, looking for any clue to the temples power.  As evidence of this, a
few blood stains burn brightly on the westernmost wall.  South leads back to
the corridor.

illuminates the floor.  Upon further inspection, a long crease runs a few
feet across the wooden floorboards, a secret perhaps?  North leads back to

Designed merely for storage purposes, this small, cramped musky room
carved out of dirt beneath the temple was used for just that, storage.  All
sorts of magical wares can be seen strewn about the available space.  A
grinning skeleton lies propped up against the far wall.  A now decrepit
silver and blue robe, once of the highest quality, wraps the macabre figure.
A small pendant can be seen, clutched in its skeletal fist.  Apparently,
this instructor crept in here when wounded by the attackers, he died a short
while after and was never found.  A small rope ladder leads back up into the
classroom.

{WSpiral Staircase{x~
An ancient spiral staircase leads down into the bottom floors of the
temple.  The rusty iron metal of the rail is practically crumbling to dust. 
Malicious odors waft up from the darkness, dried blood, smoke, and fear. 
Odd scratches appear on the walls surrounding the staircase.  The temple

Hundreds of carved stone pillars are toppled to the ground.  Pieces of
stone walls still stand, but nowhere near their former glory.  The sky above
is a swirling maelstrom of red and black clouds, and piercing white
thunderbolts.  A fierce wind carries the scent of death, hard, and putrid
into the dry air.  The scorched horizon looks very unfamiliar.  This is the
secret of the Celestial Temple, a magical gateway, existing in two
dimensions at once, and holding within the strongest magic in the realms.  A
small scorched trail leads to the north.

{rD{Dr{ra{Dg{ro{Ds{r'{Ds Dwelling{x~
The stifling heat is almost deadly in this small, smokey chamber.  A
gigantic river of lava flows from the center to places unknown, boring holes
in the walls of the chamber and flowing as it pleases.  Small sections have
flared up into flames, crackling and burning brightly.  West leads back to
the crossroads, you may recall here.

The realm of Chaos.  The strongest force in this entire dimension.  A
swirling red and black vortex is in the center of the chamber, light and
darkness swirl through it, collide with each other, and explode into dust. 
The magic in this room threatens to tear one apart at the seams it is that
dense.  The cacophony of sound droning through the chamber can crumble
mountains, the brilliance of the light flowing through can blind an army,
the magic that electrifies the air could cut down a stout man.  South leads
out of the chaotic chamber.

say I bar your entrance to the temple, tis true, but i will let you in if you prove your strength to me.

say To leave the temple say [i choose the path of the sun]
say To journey forward to danger say [i choose the path of the moon]
