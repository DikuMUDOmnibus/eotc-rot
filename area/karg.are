The temperature begins to plummet into frosty depths.  The air is dry and
very cold.  The mountains are visible in the distance, rising majestically
into the air, their peaks hidden by the clouds above.  The small snow dusted
trail leads away to the north.  It is dotted with footprints here and there.

{yBarbarian Hut{x~
This home is much larger on the inside than it appeared outside.  The
walls are decorated with different furs from different slain beasts, as much
to show off the trophy items as they are to insulate and keep the hut warm. 
A roaring fire crackles in the hearth.  The hut is spotless.  The barbarians
wifely duties are as neccessary as the husbands.  She knows her role is as
important as his in surviving this harsh climate.  South leads back to the
village road.

{cKargaranth Village{x~

barbarians.  It is a straight road running west through the village, only
defined by the extraordinary amount of tracks running through it.  There is
barbarian hut to the north.  The road contiues west and back to the east.

{bSupply Shop{x~
The shop is extremely cold despite the fire burning in the corner.  The
shopkeeper likes to keep the door open to show everyone he is open.  The
merchant who runs this place, Adiel, set up here a few years ago and has not
left since.  He took himself a wife and lives in the back of the shop.  He
often buys the skins and furs the hunters return with.  East leads back to
the road.

{gWeapons Shop{x~
Many weapons are hanging on the walls and are attached to various
shelves.  Most of the weapons are forged by the barbarians themselves.  Not
the prettiest or flashiest, but they are strong, well made and get the job
done.  They sell them to Hurungh, who in turn sells them to travelers.  West
leads back to the road.
