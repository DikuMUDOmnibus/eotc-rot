Below you is a monster you will NOT be able to kill, though it will take
a very long time for him to kill you.  It will give you plenty of time to do
something called "{cfleeing{x".  To flee all you must do is type {cflee{x,
and if you fail, simply type it again.  If you wish to skip this step
continue west.

Welcome to combat training.

The first lesson is knowing whom to fight.  Use the command 'CONSIDER' to
consider killing a monster.  Avoid fighting monsters that will kill you
easily.

The second lesson is running away.  There is a monster in the room down.
He is too strong for you to kill, but he won't kill you.  So go 'DOWN' from
here, then 'CONSIDER' him, then 'KILL' him.  After a while, type 'FLEE' to
escape from him.

You can also set your character to flee automatically with the 'WIMPY' command.
Type 'HELP WIMPY' to find out more about 'WIMPY'.

After you flee, you will be back in this room.  When you are ready to go on
to the next station, go 'WEST'.

You are in the cage room.  All around are 4 cages.  Light fluoresces off

wall.  Exits lead into the cardinal directions plus down.  You are very
close to fighting your first battle, north of you is a soldier waiting to
spar with you.  If you wait here you will be givin a "{cspellup{x" by the
angel, and your fights will go much easier with that spellup.

Welcome to the cage room.  The adepts of mud school have captured some
monsters for you to kill.  In the four cages are four monsters of various
types.  Kill them all!

After you kill each monster, get all of the equipment from their corpses
with the command 'GET ALL CORPSE'.  You can then use the command 'WEAR ALL'
to wear your newly won equipment.

When you are done with the corpse, 'SACRIFICE CORPSE' to give it to your God.
God will reward you for this.

Between combat, you may need to rest or sleep to regenerate hit points.
You can 'REST' to regenerate hit points, or you can 'SLEEP'.  'SLEEP' will
refresh you faster than 'REST', but you will be less aware of your
surroundings.
