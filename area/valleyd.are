{WEntrance to the {yValley{W of {DDeath{x~
You are standing at the begining of a large valley.  As you scan the
horizon you see a long river flowing far to the north.  The air seems to
smell of death as you travel farther into the valley.  Maybe you should turn
back now before it is too late and you add to the stench.

the mud it looks as though some small animal has been here just a little
before you.  There are many bones littering the ground all around the bank
and there are a few splatters of blood on the leaves of some of the
surrounding shrubbery.
