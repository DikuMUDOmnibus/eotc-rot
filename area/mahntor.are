{DThe Dark Woods{x~
You are travelling through woods that are as dark as night.  The trees
above block all light and wind.  The air is stagnant and smells of death and
decay.  The lack of sounds and other signs of life make your skin crawl and
you feel very much like turning back and heading for safer areas.  The path
leads north into more open lands while it also leads south into the darkness
of the forest.

You wearily travel through the darkness of the forest. Huge skeletal trees
line the edges of the path and tower above you. Errant rays of light spear
down through the gaps in the canopy above and provide small spots of light
that seem to attract what little foliage can grow on the dark forest floor.
The path winds north and south into darkness.

provides sanctuary in this land of darkness.

great battle here. Blood is everywhere and the ground is all torn up. Pieces
of beaten armour and broken blades lie all around. Examining the tracks here
lead you to believe that the dead and wounded were dragged off in two 
directions, south and east.

the forces of nature. It sways and moans as a strong wind from the south tears
through its old feeble branches. The hills themselves lead in all directions.

cave as a home. Skeletal remains lie all over. Several half-eaten corpses are
rotting away slowly in the gloomy darkness. In the back of the cave, you see a
large pile of rotting cloth, fur, and plant matter. Light and safety is

shore or head north into the hills themselves. The rocky summit you are

You weave your way through the treacherous swamp. Gas rises all around you and
a damp mist covers the ground, making it impossible to travel safely, without
carefully picking your way around obstacles. Large, gnarled trees rise above
you. Their moss covered branches block out all traces of the sun. The path
here leads east and west.

The turn in the swampy path~
You come upon a bend in the swampy path. The ground here is fairly sturdy,
as this place is elevated above the rest of the swamp. Looking around, you see
a dark, mist filled swamp. Small paths lead south and west into the mist.

Standing before the throne~
You stand before the throne of Mahn-Tor. This golden throne is so huge that it
takes up almost the entire wall, stretching far above the floor. Sitting upon
it, you feel small and feeble. It is evident that this throne is more of a
decoration than anything else. Only the largest of kings could sit upon it.
The hall leads south and west into other parts of the keep.
