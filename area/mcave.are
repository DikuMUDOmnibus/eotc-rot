A {Ws{we{Wr{we{Wn{we and {Wt{wr{Wa{wn{Wq{wu{Wi{wl {yawe {bswirls{w through this rather large 
chamber.  A {btrickling {Cs{ct{Cr{ce{Ca{cm{x cuts the room in two equal halves. 
At the head of the {cs{Ct{cr{Ce{ca{cm{w is a {Wroaring {Bw{ba{ct{wer{cf{ba{Bll{w.  How the {cstream{w 
exists there is anyones guess, but oddities such as that occur 
in the presence of {Yimmortals{w.  The chamber is circular with a 
domed ceiling.  Hanging from the center, almost forty feet above 
the ground is a {yglistening {Wcrystal {Yc{yh{Ya{yn{Yd{ye{Yl{yi{Ye{yr{w suspended from a 
legnth of {ygold{w chain. {YGlowing {ycandleabras{w adorn the walls spouting
off {Mm{ma{Mg{mi{Mc {Bblue {rflames{w, making the room exquisitely {Ybright{w.  There 
are no exits, an immortal may come and go as he pleases, any 
{gwhere{w and any {btime{w.  Rest assured that if {Ryou{w are seeing such a 
place, a {Ywonderful gift{w or {Dgrave trouble{w will soon your way come.{x

{DRoland's Torture Chamber{x~
Wow, you must of done something really stupid to end up in here.  Better
bite your tongue next time.  The walls are oppressive and bleak.  The floor
is uncomfortable.  You will die slowly in here as the hours and days pass. 
You will feel it, unrelenting until Roland decides you have had enough.
