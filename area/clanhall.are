{DA large pentagram drawn in freshly spilled blood serves as the
reception area for soldiers of Legion.  Thousands of candles are burning all
around, but their combined light does little to pierce the darkness of this
unholy room.  A large statue in the assumed visage of the force that drives
these insane warriors looms at the back of the room.  A throbbing force can
be felt, hanging poised in the air, as if ready to strike.  Screams of
torture and torment echo around the corridors of this sacreligous asylum,
the moans and agonized sounds of the torturous wretches that are Legion
captives.  A small, magical one-way staircase leads down to the center of
the Legion hunting grounds, the Market Square of Gaalstrom.  {x

{DA menacing serenity swirls through these dark chambers.  A pulsing red
light, the healing force of Legion throbs in the center of the room.  A
crimson hued pool dominates most of this dark place, filled to the brim with
blood.  A thousand and more candles are burning brightly in a dark shade of
red.  West leads back to the recall area, this room is a safe and tranquil
place to heal your battleworn body.  {x

{DA peaceful and holy church defiled by the undead nightwalkers of the
Dark Brood.  The crucifixes were torn down and destroyed, the alter smeared
with blood and carved with the arcane symbols of demons.  The stained glass
has been painted over with blood.  The walls and floors are also smeared in
the unmistakable dry crimson liquid.  There is barely any light in the room
save for a few candles.  Hundreds of coffins lie scattered about, some
sitting ceremoniously up on the pews of the church.  A magical staircase
leads down into the Dark Brood feeding grounds, Gaalstrom.  {x

{W{xAn overwhelming sense of good, and light flows through this sacred
temple.  This is the epitome of everything pure in the realms.  The temple
is unbelievably well crafted.  Wonderfully crafted pillars run from the
marble floor to the domed ceiling up above.  A thousand and more candles are
burning, their soft light dances and plays on the stone walls, illuminating
vast murals depicting the triumphs of the Crusaders, banishing evil, slaying
the wicked.  A magical staircase leads down to the center of Gaalstrom.  {x
A small hallway leads to a healing chamber east.

A circular chamber off the central part of the temple.  The ceiling is
domed with a wonderful painting contained within.  There are a dozen or so
stained glass windows in the walls, the light shines through them and
illuminates the chamber in a thousand different shades of color.  A large
healing pool bubbles gently in the ground, west leads back to the central
chamber.

{gH{yu{gn{yt{ge{yr{g'{ys {GG{yr{Go{yv{Ge{x~
{gA forest of beauty beyond word and thought.  The very essence of what
the rangers and striders of the realms fight to protect.  A large canopy of
thick bushy leaves block most of the light, letting only a few scarce rays
pierce through to the ground.  The floor of the grove is covered with red
and golden yellow leaves that kick up into a flurry whenever a good sized
breeze rolls through.  The grove is but a circle, surrounded on the edges by
large bushes containing thousands of blossoms.  The spaces beyond the grove
are alive and tingling with animal life, bird calls, deer rushing past all
wish to be close to the ranger home.  To the far west a large river can be
heard, rushing along its course for ages out of mind.  A small magical hole
is in the ground, it leads to the center of Gaalstrom.  {x
