A spacious abode with plenty of ceiling height and plush blue wall to

Janeev's Home~
As you enter, you are suprised with how light it is.  There are a large
amount of windows that cover the room, most painted in murals of peace and
glory.  The walls and floor are pure white giving the appearance of it being
large.  The floors are hard mohagony wood, polished to a shine.  There are
variose sculptures and paintings hanging around the room.  2 huge skylights
let light in from the roof, and on a clear night, the moon can be seen high
over head.  This is truley a house of Good and hope.

Gaebril's Home~
The door into this place consists of an opaque, almost water-like blue
wall.  When pressing upon it, it gives slightly...  And when pushed through,
what seems to be only an inch thick takes about three steps to walk through.
Once through, the room is lit...  But only dimly.  It takes a few moments
for the eyes to adjust, and once they do, the sight isn't comforting.  A
carved stone chamber, there seems room for only one occupant...  The person
behind the desk facing you.  With a slight rise between you and the desk,
there's a barely recognizable sense of looking up, always putting the
enterer in a slight state of disadvantage...

Cuthbert's Home~
You stand inside a damp dwelling
You stand inside a damp dwelling. No pictures adorn the wall. 
It is evident that the owner isn't quite human, a demon
perhaps. It is quite hot in here.
