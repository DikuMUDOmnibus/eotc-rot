{WOn a Mountain Path{x~
You're walking along a small path through the Northern Mountains.  Few
know of this path other then the survivors of the 'War of the Ancients'. 
South leads back to the Northern Mountain's main path.  There are rumors of
a legendary city to the north beyond the mountains.

The path gets a little uneven here.  The snow doesn't seem to be as
heavy, either.  The path slowly is slowing downward as you continue east. 
You can turn back to the west to reach the main path through the Nortern
Mountains.

east.  You notice scratch marks on the cliff side.  From here you can either
go west back to the main path or north to some legendary city.

can't see anything...  It's pitch black.  You can turn back to the south or
continue into the cavern.

The cavern is dark and moist.  Luckily you have a light source with you. 
You can see an even brighter light coming from a hole to your west.  Perhaps
it's best to get out of here as soon as possible.

taller hills east and west of you.  The path continues north.  South leads

You drop down the cliff with relative ease.  It's short enough to get
back up if you wanted to.  You look to the north and notice that the path
comes to a stop.  A painting on a boulder makes the illusion that it goes on
forever.  The actual path continues to the west.

You've made it this far...  The path continues to the north.  A slightly

the north.  It is rumored that wilderness lies beyond these mountains, and
eventually a legendary city.
