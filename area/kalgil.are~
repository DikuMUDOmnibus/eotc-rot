The Rear Temple~
A the last room in the east wing of the temple, the floor is hard and
bare, the entire room is rather spartan and unattractive.  Dust has
collected on every shelf and stone, it has obviously not been used for a
long time.

The Main Road~
The stones beneath your feet are in bad repair but that does not tarnish
the view of the temple to the south or of the silver gate to the far north. 
People are wandering around here, a dog is roaming the streets, a very
friendly setting.
